            Karkov is a personal project made by me that is based on the game ©Escape From Tarkov.
            It is a game where you can loot items and earn money. You can deposit your loot in the stash and use it
            later.
            The idea for this app is to send a "Team" out to loot and after the raid time is up, you get 3 items from
            the raid.
            The items can be sold for money or you can keep them for later if they are key items. The money can be used
            to buy keys to use in raid and increase chances of finding better loot.
            This app is still in development and I am working on it.
